# adwaita-center-minimize-button

A very simple script.

This centers the minimize button on the window toolbar by using the "value-decrease" icon.

It annoyed me too.

## How to use?

1. Download "Center Minimize Button.sh"
2. Locate "Center Minimize Button.sh" in the Downloads folder
3. Right click the file, select "Properties" and toggle "Executable as Program" to the 'on' state
4. Right click the file once more, and press "Run as a Program"
5. Enter your `sudo` password
6. Restart the system for the changes to take effect
7. Optionally, you can delete "Center Minimize Button.sh" to save disk space

## Why do I need to use `sudo`?

The directory containing the system icons can only be written to by someone using `sudo`, since they are technically system files.

## Is this script malicious?

No. You can check the source before you run it to be certain.
